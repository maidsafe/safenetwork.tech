But once the benefits of a new web built on the SAFE Network become clear—permanent data, never again stored by untrustworthy and hackable third parties that you alone can access at any time from anywhere around the globe—the value becomes clearer. There’s a huge amount of work required to build a system that can deliver on such promises. So to get you started, here’s a few pointers about some of the technology that lies under the hood.'

It's the only decentralised Network in the world that lets someone securely and anonymously create an account and log in without needing a third party to manage the login process or to store and manage users' credentials.

Your photo starts by being broken into pieces which are then encrypted with the other parts of that same file. This 'Self-Encryption' happens before the data ever hits the Network. So, unless you choose to override it, none of your data touches the Network unless it is encrypted. And it’s designed so that you're the only one that ever holds the key.`,
            `This is a very different approach to blockchain-based storage platforms which often secure just the pointer that shows where the data is stored. With data stored elsewhere, you can prove that data hasn’t been tampered with. But it doesn't protect the data itself. The SAFE Network has a different approach altogether. The data itself is encrypted and stored on the Network. That means no data stores to protect elsewhere.`

Without reading them, he’d have to know  which encrypted chunks made up any one file; where each piece was stored; control a number of computers that has responsibility for managing each of those different locations on the Network at any one point in time; and then somehow break the encryption (with no password!).',
