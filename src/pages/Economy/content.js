            question: 'What are Safe Network Tokens?',
            answer: [
              `Safe Network Tokens are digital tokens that are generated automatically by the Safe Network and reside on the Safe Network. The Network will autonomously confirm account balances to wallets and allow transactions to take place. Safe Network Tokens are transferred using the digital signature of the coin’s last owner. This operation is 'network atomic'—in other words, the Network ensures that all copies update to reflect the transaction. This is a different approach to the blockchain mechanism employed in other projects, such as Bitcoin.`,
              'There can be many millions of transactions per second on the Safe Network and the larger it becomes the more transactions per second can be executed. A Safe Network Token only records the previous and current owners. By doing so, it ensures that the current owner was transferred ownership properly by the last owner. This allows coins to be transferred between people very easily and without delay.',
              'Please note that Safe Network Tokens will not be active until the network goes live. See MaidSafeCoin for current proxy token.'

              'Safe Network Tokens are the currency of the Safe Network. They are an incentive mechanism that rewards Users and developers, as well as providing access to network services.',
              'Without any human intervention, the Safe Network pays out Tokens automatically to Farmers (users who join the Network by contributing their computing resources) and to Builders (application developers, who get paid automatically depending on how much their applications are used).',
              'In addition, Core Developers who improve the core Safe Network codebase can also earn Tokens by providing bug fixes and new features.',
              `Safe Network Tokens only live on the Safe Network. They are stored in a User's wallet and can be used to buy network services, such as increased storage space and access to network applications.

            question: 'How will Farming work?',
            answer: [
              'When a user of the network requests some data, for example by browsing a website, a number of things happen: First, the client software makes a request for the required data chunks. This message (a GET request) is then propagated across the Network and when the chunk is found there is a competition between the Nodes in that Section to deliver it to the Network where it will be routed back to the requester.  The first Node to deliver will have a chance of being rewarded with one Safe Network Token. This is described as a Farming Attempt.',
              'Farming Attempt means: by delivering data chunks when requested, a Node occasionally gains the opportunity to make a Farming Attempt. This consists of sending a validated request to a random Safe Network Token address. If an owned Token already exists at that address, the Attempt fails. If there are no Tokens there, one is created and awarded to the requesting Node (i.e. a successful Farming Attempt has been made).',
              'Farming is therefore when a Node delivers data chunks that it is storing to the Network and earns Tokens in return. The probability of gaining a Farming Attempt is dependent on the farming_rate, which is a variable related to the quantity of available storage resources in the Network.'
