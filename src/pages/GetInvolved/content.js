This is a measure to stop the test network being spammed during development. \n* Open the SAFE browser. \n* Click ‘Create Account’ at the bottom of the screen. \n* In the next screen select ‘Claim An Invitation’. \n* Login to the forum within the SAFE Browser, the setup process will prompt you to do this if you have not already done so. \n* Select the Alpha 2 Network. \n* The installer will now provide you with your invitation code. Please note: it is important that your current and registered IPs match, if they do not, click to update. \n* Copy the invite code at the bottom of the screen and paste this back into the field that asks for an ‘Invitation Token’ in the SAFE Browser. \n* You will now be asked to create an Account Secret and Password. Please make sure you keep these safe as only you will ever have access to your credentials. There is no central record of these credentials anywhere within the system and without them you will not be able to access your data. \n* Congratulations! You are now ready to not just browse the SAFE Network, but upload your own data, create websites and use some of the demo apps being worked on by the community.`
