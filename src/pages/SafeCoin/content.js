            answer: [
              `Safecoin are digital tokens that are generated automatically by the SAFE Network and reside on the SAFE Network. The Network will autonomously confirm account balances to wallets and allow transactions to take place. Safecoin are transferred using the digital signature of the coin’s last owner. This operation is 'network atomic'—in other words,the Network ensures that all copies update to reflect the transaction. This is a different approach to the blockchain mechanism employed in other projects, such as Bitcoin.`,
              'There can be many millions of transactions per second on the SAFE Network and the larger it becomes the more transactions per second can be executed. A Safecoin only records the previous and current owners. By doing so, it ensures that the current owner was transferred ownership properly by the last owner. This allows coins to be transferred between people very easily and without delay.',

            answer: [
              'When a user of the network requests some data, for example by browsing a website, a number of things happen: First, the client software makes a request for the required data chunks. This message (a GET request) is then propagated across the Network and when the chunk is found there is a competition between the Vaults in that Section to deliver it to the Network where it will be routed back to the requester.  The first Vault to deliver will have a chance of being rewarded with one Safecoin. This is described as a Farming Attempt.',
              'Farming Attempt means: by delivering data chunks when requested, a Vault occasionally gains the opportunity to make a Farming Attempt. This consists of sending a validated request to a random Safecoin address. If an owned Safecoin already exists at that address, the Attempt fails. If there is no Safecoin there, one is created and awarded to the requesting Vault (i.e. a successful Farming Attempt has been made).',
              'Farming is therefore when a Vault delivers data chunks that it is storing to the network and earns Safecoin in return. The probability of gaining a Farming Attempt is dependent on the farming_rate, which is a variable related to the quantity of available storage resources in the Network.'
